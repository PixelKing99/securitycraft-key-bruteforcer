a macro that will bruteforce the passcodes of various blocks and items from the securitycraft mod for minecraft, it was intended to only be used by me so its not very good, it should be garenteed to work if you are using a windows 10 1080p monitor, the locations of buttons will probably need to be changed otherwise

the devs added a cooldown to entering passcodes so this is far less useful however its stil somewhat practical for briefcases and can crack them in an hour or so i think
