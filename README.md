a macro that will bruteforce the passcodes of various blocks and items from the securitycraft mod for minecraft, it was intended to only be used by me so its not very good

the devs added a cooldown to entering passcodes so this is far less useful however its still somewhat practical for briefcases and can crack them in an hour or so i think

to use just install the requirements.txt and then run passwordbreaker.py
if you are on linux you will need to be root to run it
